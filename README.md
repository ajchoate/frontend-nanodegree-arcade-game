# Arcade Game Clone
===============================

In this repository you will find a simplified clone of the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

### Gameplay and Rules

Use the direction keys to move your player around on screen. Your goal is to avoid the ladybugs and collect all the stars.

- You score a point each time you make it to the water
- You lose a point any time you collide with a ladybug
- Collecting a star or reaching the water will reset your player to the starting square
- You win and the game ends when you collect the final star
